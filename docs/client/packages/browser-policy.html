## `browser-policy`

The `browser-policy` package lets you set security-related policies that will be
enforced by newer browsers. These policies help you prevent and mitigate common
attacks like cross-site scripting and clickjacking.

`browser-policy` lets you configure the HTTP headers X-Frame-Options and
Content-Security-Policy. X-Frame-Options tells the browser which websites are
allowed to frame your app. You should only let trusted websites frame your app,
because malicious sites could harm your users
with <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking">clickjacking
attacks</a>.
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy">Content-Security-Policy</a>
tells the browser where your app can load content from, which encourages safe
practices and mitigates the damage of a cross-site-scripting attack.

For most apps, we recommend that you use the
[`starter-browser-policy`](#starterbrowserpolicy) package to enable reasonable
policies, and then use the functions below to tighten or relax the policies as
necessary. For example, an app that only loads content from its own origin and
that doesn't use inline Javascript should use `starter-browser-policy` and then
call `BrowserPolicy.disallowInlineScripts()` to gain additional security against
cross-site scripting attacks.

You can use the following functions to specify which websites are allowed to
frame your app:
<dl class="callbacks">
{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.disallowFraming()"}}
Your app will never render inside a frame or iframe.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.allowFramingByOrigin(origin)"}}
Your app will only render inside frames loaded by `origin`. You can only call
this function once with a single origin, and cannot use wildcards or specify
multiple origins that are allowed to frame your app. (This is a limitation of
the X-Frame-Options header.) Example values of `origin` include
"http://example.com" and "https://foo.example.com".
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.allowFramingBySameOrigin()"}}
Your app will only render inside frames loaded by webpages on the same origin as
your app.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.allowFramingByAnyOrigin()"}}
Your app can be framed by any website.
{{/dtdd}}
</dl>

You can use these functions to tighten or relax restrictions on where Javascript
and CSS can be run:

<dl class="callbacks">
{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.allowInlineScripts()"}}
Allows inline `<script>` tags, `javascript:` URLs, and inline event handlers.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.disallowInlineScripts()"}}
Disallows inline Javascript. Calling this function results in an extra
round-trip on page load to retrieve Meteor runtime configuration that is usually
part of an inline script tag.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.allowEval()"}}
Allows the creation of Javascript code from strings using function such as `eval()`.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.disallowEval()"}}
Disallows eval and related functions.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.allowInlineStyles()"}}
Allows inline style tags and style attributes.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.disallowInlineStyles()"}}
Disallows inline CSS.
{{/dtdd}}
</dl>

Finally, you can configure a whitelist of allowed requests that various types of
content can make. The following functions are defined for the content types
script, object, image, media, font, and connect.

<dl class="callbacks">
{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.allow&lt;ContentType&gt;Origin(origin)"}}
Allows this type of content to be loaded from the given origin. `origin` is a
string and can include an optional scheme (such as `http` or `https`), an
optional wildcard at the beginning, and an optional port which can be a
wildcard. Examples include `example.com`, `https://*.example.com`, and
`example.com:*`. You can call these functions multiple times with different
origins to specify a whitelist of allowed origins.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.allow&lt;ContentType&gt;DataUrl()"}}
Allows this type of content to be loaded from a `data:` URL.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.allow&lt;ContentType&gt;SameOrigin()"}}
Allows this type of content to be loaded from the same origin as your app.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.disallow&lt;ContentType&gt;()"}}
Disallows this type of content on your app.
{{/dtdd}}
</dl>

These functions are also defined for the content type `AllContent`, which sets
defaults for content types that you haven't configured using one of the above
functions. For example, if you want to allow all content to be loaded from your
app's origin but you want to disable `<object>` tags, you can simply call
`BrowserPolicy.allowAllContentSameOrigin()` followed by
`BrowserPolicy.disallowObject()`.

Other examples of using the `BrowserPolicy` API:

* `BrowserPolicy.disallowObject()` causes the browser to disallow all
`<object>` tags.
* `BrowserPolicy.allowImageOrigin("https://example.com")`
allows images to have their `src` attributes point to images served from
`https://example.com`.
* `BrowserPolicy.allowConnectOrigin("https://example.com")` allows XMLHttpRequest
and WebSocket connections to `https://example.com`.
