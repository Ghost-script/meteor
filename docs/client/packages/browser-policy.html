## `browser-policy`

The `browser-policy` package lets you set security-related policies that will be
enforced by newer browsers. These policies help you prevent and mitigate common
attacks like cross-site scripting and clickjacking.

`browser-policy` lets you configure the HTTP headers X-Frame-Options and
Content-Security-Policy. X-Frame-Options tells the browser which websites are
allowed to frame your app. You should only let trusted websites frame your app,
because malicious sites could harm your users with <a href="">clickjacking
attacks</a>. <a href="">Content-Security-Policy</a> tells the browser where your
app can load content from, which encourages safe practices and mitigates the
damage of a cross-site-scripting attack.

You can use the following functions to specify which websites are allowed to
frame your app:
<dl class="callbacks">
{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.disallowFraming()"}}
Your app will never render inside a frame or iframe.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.allowFramingByOrigin(origin)"}}
Your app will only render inside frames loaded by `origin` (such as
http://meteor.com). You can only call this function once with a single origin,
and cannot specify multiple origins that are allowed to frame your app.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.allowFramingBySameOrigin()"}}
Your app will only render inside frames loaded by webpages on the same origin as
your app.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.allowFramingByAnyOrigin()"}}
Your app can be framed by any website.
{{/dtdd}}
