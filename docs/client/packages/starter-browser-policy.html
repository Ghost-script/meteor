## `starter-browser-policy`

The `starter-browser-policy` package provides a recommended configuration for
the [`browser-policy`](#browserpolicy) package. When you add
`starter-browser-policy` to your app, the following policies will be enforced by
browsers that support the X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy headers:

* Only webpages on the same origin as your app can frame your app.
* Your app can only load content (images, scripts, fonts, etc.) from its own
origin, except that XMLHttpRequests and WebSocket connections can go to any
origin.
* Your app's client code cannot use functions such as `eval()` that convert
strings to Javascript code.

If your app does not need any inline Javascript such as inline `<script>` tags,
we recommend that you modify this policy by calling
`BrowserPolicy.disallowInlineScripts()` on the server. This will result in one
extra round trip when your app is loaded, but will help prevent cross-site
scripting attacks by disabling all scripts except those loaded from a `script
src` attribute.
