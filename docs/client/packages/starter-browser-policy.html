## `starter-browser-policy`

The `starter-browser-policy` package provides a recommended configuration for the
`browser-policy` package. When you add `starter-browser-policy` to your app, the
following policies will be enforced by browsers that support the X-Frame-Options
and Content-Security-Policy headers:

<ul>
<li> Only webpages on the same origin as your app can frame your app.</li>
<li> Your app can only load content (images, scripts, fonts, etc.) from its own
origin, except that XMLHttpRequests and WebSocket connections can go to any
origin.</li>
<li> Your app's client code cannot use functions such as eval that convert
strings to Javascript code.</li>
</ul>

If your app does not need any inline Javascript such as inline `<script>` tags,
we recommend that you modify this policy by calling
`BrowserPolicy.disallowInlineScripts()` on the server. This will result in one
extra round trip when your app is loaded, but will help prevent cross-site
scripting attacks by disabling all scripts except those loaded from a `script
src` attribute.
